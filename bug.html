I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly, specifically the `text-red-500` class.  My HTML structure seemed fine, and the Tailwind directives in my `tailwind.config.js` were also correct. However, the text remained its default color.  I checked the browser's developer tools and there were no errors reported.  I also confirmed that the CSS file was being correctly linked in the HTML. The issue persisted across different browsers.
